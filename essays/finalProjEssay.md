<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

The Helium Network is a decentralized network that transmits data over LoRaWAN, and rewards its hotspot owners with the $HNT token for Proof of Coverage (PoC). Launched in 2019, it has climbed to be the largest, public, decentralized LoRaWAN Network in the world. With rapid accelerated growth, adopters of multiple hotspots on the network struggle to monitor the activity of said hotspots effectively. With the Helium Dev team focused on improvements to the PoC algorithm, and combating spoofing, the management of earnings, transaction history, and diagnostics has been set aside with the ability of the community to handle these shortcomings via the Helium API.<br><br>

A web interface that users can login to that displays the status, history, and data on their hotspots would allow for informed monitoring of the data across multiple hotspots  as the network continues to grow. Access to earnings, transaction history, and diagnostics allows for hotspot contributors to react to changes in the network effectively.<br>

<h1 id="approach">Approach</h1>

Possible pages for user data visualization for include
- Overview of network wide data (Token to USD price, hotspots total, current block)
- User earnings page
- User miner overview page
- User diagnostic page (last connection time,  transmit ratio, etc)
- Map of miner’s connections page<br>
  
 <h1 id="use-case-ideas">Use Case Ideas</h1>

- Miner pools to track all user contributions to divide payment
- Individuals to track multiple installations of miners in varying placements
- Developers to quickly visualize network specific data or historical performances of miners

<h1 id="beyond-the-basics">Beyond the Basics</h1>

Dashboard to showcase earnings by day, week, and all time
Map page to show hotspot beacons (interactions with other hotspots)
Display wallet contents, payment history, and price in USD
Display hotspot diagnostics ( location, uptime, antenna dbi, installation height, time since last interaction)
Main page for overall Helium statistics (USD price for 1 HNT Token, block height, total number of hotspots in network, news related to the project)
