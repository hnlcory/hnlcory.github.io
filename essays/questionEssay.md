With the complexity of software increasing as large scale projects become more common, it is common for even the most prestigious developers to come across software bugs that require the assistance of other developers. One of the core positives of the development community is the accessibility of information. Almost any basic problem a user can run into has likely been solved with an explanation online. It is then on the individual themselves to seek out this info online.<br><br>

In some niche cases, this information may be old/outdated or may not be clear in the reasoning for it’s solution. This is where the importance of “smart” questions exists. While every programmer must inherently begin somewhere, it is important that questions with relatively simple solutions aren’t repeatedly asked. Structure, and organization is just as important with questions in a community as it is in code itself. Taking steps to ask “smart” questions when needed helps to maintain these core values.<br><br>

In this example, we see the user begins with a clear title, asking for the use of std::move in std::accumulate. In the body of the question they also list the environment they are working with, and the specific compiler used (g++). They also include a function definition of the function in question as a properly formatted code, not a picture. While it could be argued that documentation on the functions could aid in drawing conclusions about the answer, the question does pose a genuine question about two approaches to reach the same result. A properly thought out question like this is given an equally thought out answer, as evidenced by the multiple clear replies. This is a good example of utilizing the expertise of the programing community with smart questions.<br><br>
