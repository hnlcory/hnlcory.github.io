<p>
Carpool-And-Go is a web application project that aims to provide a communal network for University of Hawaii at Manoa, allowing for drivers to offer rides, and for riders to be able to search for drivers in their area. The goal of the project is take in what we have learned over the course of the semester to create a functioning meteor application that reflects teachings of the ICS 314 - Software Engineering course while providing exposure to Software development when a group scenario is given. 
</p>

<p>
This project was created using the Meteor framework in order to develop a Full-Stack Javascript application. The project is build on Javascript with MongoDB handling the database. UI components are developed with Semantic UI utilizing the official React integration. Testing for the application is automated via Test Café tests, and coding standards/error management are maintained via ESLint. Currently, the main build is deployed via Digital Ocean, and can be visited <a href="https://uh-carpool-and-go.xyz/#/">here</a>.

<p>
Users of the application have a profile that displays the User in question’s profile as well as their role, location, profile picture, arrive and leave time, contact information, and their rating. Users can filter possible Drivers or Riders by their location to quickly find other carpool partners. Users can see the rating of other user's noted by a rating of 1-5 stars. Users may rate other users based on their experiences with them. In the event of a last-minute ride, users may request a ride using the fast-ride feed, allowing them to connect with people in last minute scenarios.

Users who have admin privileges (users whose email addresses end with @carpoolngo.com) have access to the Admin page, allowing them to audit all accounts stored in the website. They may view or edit details of other accounts as well as deleting accounts from the database. They may also filter accounts based on location.

While testing the website in its final stages, we took the time to receive thoughts and opinions from other UH community members. Overall feedback has shown the website's core features to be functioning properly. Overall feedback was positive, with suggestions as to various paths towards features to improve the functionality, and usability of the website.
